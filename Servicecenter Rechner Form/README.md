# Servicecenter Rechner Form

The submission if this forms data is handled as part of the Servicecenter Rechner. There is a dedicated PHP method to do this (inside `ServiceCenterRechnerDispatcher.php`). I just copied out and pasted the function into a PHP file in this repository. For more context go to the Servicecenter repository itself.
